This repository manages kubernetes clusters that run on Talos Linux by Sidero Labs whos documentation may be found [here](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/introduction/). The Talos Linux kubernetes nodes are managed by Sidero Lab's Omni software who's documentation may be found [here](https://docs.siderolabs.com/omni/overview/what-is-omni). The use of the utility Talosctl is limited as the utility Omnictl handles cluster management.

This repository follows patterns put into place by a group of kubernetes home lab enthusiests who meet in the `Home Operations` discord. They use to manage popular helm charts known as `k8s at home` but those have been deprecated. Instead of individual charts most services may be hosted using [bjw-s-labs app template](https://bjw-s-labs.github.io/helm-charts/docs/app-template/)

Excellent examples of `home-ops` repositories would be [onedr0p's](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops) and [bjw-s-labs'](https://github.com/bjw-s-labs/home-ops). Note these are single cluster repositorys. A multi cluster example would be [szinn's](https://github.com/szinn/k8s-homelab)
