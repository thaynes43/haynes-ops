# PiKVM

See `./pikvm.yaml` for example config - I am manually keeping this in sync with what is on the device.

## Editing Config

To edit config in pikvm terminal:

```yaml
su -
rw
nano /etc/kvmd/override.yaml
ro
exit
```

## TeSMART 16 device KVM integration

TODO this was tricky document before moving
