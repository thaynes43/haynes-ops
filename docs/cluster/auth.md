# Auth

Page for ideas on auth and eventually what I went with

## Examples

This has some cool annotations for nginx and authelia - https://github.com/mchestr/home-cluster/blob/main/kubernetes/apps/default/esphome/app/helmrelease.yaml

May be worth seeing exactly what is going on in this cluster for netwroking etc. Cilium seems to be load balancer of choice for Talos users.
