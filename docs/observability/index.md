# Observability

Do this FIRST to save time later (said noone)

## TODO

- Setup kromogo
- Use kromogo on github readme after I migrate the cluster and use the other public IP
- review smartctl-exporter
- review snmp-exporter
- review unpoller
- Gatus templates need fixing
- I did not include or turned off out a bunch of stuff since the observability stack wasn't set up. I need to review resources to see what needs to be enabled
- Grafana and initial dashboards
- add custom dashboards etc
