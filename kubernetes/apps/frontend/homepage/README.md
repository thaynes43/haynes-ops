Homepage is a highly configurable service so I am creating some docs to remember what to do.

## Config 

- [This example](https://github.com/rafaribe/home-ops/blob/main/kubernetes/main/apps/services/homepage/app/configuration.yaml) is pretty comprehensive.

## Secrets
See [this](# https://github.com/rafaribe/home-ops/blob/main/kubernetes/main/apps/services/homepage/app/externalsecret.yaml) repo for some great examples of what types of secrets are needed.
